## 🌿 Branching Model

* `main` – stable, deployable
* `dev` – integration branch for features
* `feat/<short-name>` – new features
* `fix/<short-name>` – bug fixes
* `chore/<short-name>` – tooling/docs

Create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/menu-improvements
```

---

## ✍️ Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

Use one of:

* `feat: …` new feature
* `fix: …` bug fix
* `docs: …` docs only
* `style: …` formatting (no code change)
* `refactor: …` no feature/bug change
* `test: …` tests only
* `chore: …` tooling/config

Example:

```
feat: add floating menu and topbar alignment
fix: handle empty text uploads in traditional mode
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Manual QA

Before opening a PR:

1. **Run the app** and verify:

   * Login/Signup flow works
   * After login, **Traditional Mode** loads by default
   * Mode toggles work (Traditional ↔ Meme)
   * Menu button opens sidebar with **Profile, Admin (if role=admin), Logout**
   * File uploads: text, image, audio, video save without errors
2. **Mobile check**
   Use browser dev tools → Device toolbar (e.g., iPhone 12) and ensure:

   * Top bar aligns (title left, menu right)
   * Buttons don’t overflow
   * Sidebar opens and is usable

---

## 🧯 Code Style & Guidelines

* **Python**: keep functions small; prefer pure functions in utils
* **Streamlit**:

  * Use `st.session_state` for auth/session flags
  * Avoid global reassignments; call `st.rerun()` after state changes
  * Keep pages self-contained (`pages/*.py`)
* **File I/O**:

  * Use `utils/file_handler.py` for all disk reads/writes
  * Don’t hardcode paths; rely on helpers

---

## 🔐 Security / Privacy

* Don’t log passwords.
* Keep dummy admin in `ensure_admin_user()` only for local dev.
* No personal data in commits.

## ✅ Pull Request Checklist

* [ ] Scope limited to one logical change
* [ ] Tested locally (desktop + mobile layout)
